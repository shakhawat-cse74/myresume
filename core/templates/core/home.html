        <p style="text-indent: 100px;">I’m <b class="text-warning">Shakhawat</b> and I’ll be your teacher this year. I always enjoy staying at home and hitting a good mystery book! I’m not much of an outdoor person, as you can see. I love rainy days where I can wrap myself in a blanket and binge-watch series without feeling guilty!</p>

        <p>Do you know why I love English? Because it makes me feel like I have a superpower! And my goal this year is to help you become the best English speakers possible. What do you love the most?”

        I like introducing myself as approachable, so I break the “teacher” mold and show a glimpse of my personality.</p>
        <p>The best advice I could give you is to keep your introductions short and light. You’ll also want to give the other person room for follow-up questions. </p>
